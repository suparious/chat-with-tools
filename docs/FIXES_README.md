# Chat with Tools Framework - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed (September 13, 2025)

### 1. Tool Argument Parsing Error
**Problem:** When using the search tool, the agent was failing with error: `'str' object has no attribute 'items'`

**Root Cause:** The LLM was sometimes sending tool arguments in unexpected formats (plain strings instead of JSON objects), and the agent wasn't handling these cases properly.

**Solution:** Enhanced the `handle_tool_call` method in `agent.py` to:
- Detect different argument formats (string, JSON string, dictionary)
- Automatically wrap plain strings in a `query` parameter for search tools
- Add robust type checking and conversion
- Provide better error messages for debugging

### 2. Configuration Validation
**Problem:** The configuration manager was raising hard errors when API keys were missing, preventing users from testing with local vLLM endpoints.

**Root Cause:** The `_validate_config` method was too strict about API key requirements.

**Solution:** Modified `config_manager.py` to:
- Show warnings instead of errors for missing API keys
- Allow the framework to continue with local endpoints
- Provide helpful guidance about API key configuration

## Files Modified

1. **src/chat_with_tools/agent.py**
   - Enhanced `handle_tool_call` method (lines 247-273)
   - Improved `validate_tool_arguments` method (lines 196-234)
   - Added type checking and conversion logic
   - Better error handling and logging

2. **src/chat_with_tools/config_manager.py**
   - Modified `_validate_config` method (lines 110-143)
   - Changed from raising errors to showing warnings
   - More flexible configuration handling

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Imports
Run the import test to verify all modules load correctly:
```bash
uv run python test_imports.py
```

### 2. Test Tool Argument Parsing
Run the tool fix test to verify the search tool handles various argument formats:
```bash
uv run python test_tool_fix.py
```

### 3. Run the Main Application
Try the main application with the fixed code:
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

## How the Fix Works

The agent now handles tool arguments more robustly:

1. **JSON String Arguments**: Parsed normally with `json.loads()`
2. **Plain String Arguments**: If parsing fails and the tool expects a `query` parameter, wraps the string in `{"query": "string value"}`
3. **Dictionary Arguments**: Used directly without parsing
4. **Other Types**: Converted to dictionary if possible

This ensures that regardless of how the LLM formats the tool arguments, the agent can handle them gracefully.

## Verifying the Fix

When you run the agent now and ask it to search for something, you should see:
- The search tool being called successfully
- Results being returned from DuckDuckGo
- No more "'str' object has no attribute 'items'" errors

## Example Usage

```python
# In the chat interface
User: Search the web for 3rd gen camaro LS engine swap kits

# The agent should now:
1. Parse the request
2. Call the search_web tool with appropriate arguments
3. Return search results
4. Summarize the findings
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Debug Logging**: Enhanced error messages to help identify issues
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: The system now tries multiple approaches before failing
3. **Type Safety**: Added type checking to prevent similar issues in the future

## Next Steps

If you encounter any other issues:
1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Run the test scripts to verify functionality
3. Ensure your config.yaml is properly configured
4. Try with different LLM models if one is causing issues

## Notes

- The framework now works with both OpenRouter API keys and local vLLM endpoints
- Configuration warnings don't block execution
- Tool discovery and loading is working correctly
- All imports and module paths have been verified
