# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records - documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the Chat with Tools framework.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are short documents that capture:
- The context of a decision
- The decision made
- The rationale behind it
- The consequences (positive, negative, and neutral)

## Current ADRs

### [[ADR-001-plugin-tool-architecture|ADR-001: Plugin Tool Architecture]]
Decision about the modular tool system design.

### [[ADR-002-multi-agent-orchestration|ADR-002: Multi-Agent Orchestration]]
Design decisions for the task orchestrator and multi-agent collaboration.

## Upcoming Decisions

- Tool security model
- Configuration management strategy
- API versioning approach
- Package distribution structure

## ADR Process

1. **Identify** a significant architectural decision
2. **Create** a new ADR using the [[../../_templates/adr-template|template]]
3. **Status**: Start as "Proposed"
4. **Review** with team/stakeholders
5. **Update** status to "Accepted" or "Rejected"
6. **Implement** the decision
7. **Supersede** if replaced by a new decision

## ADR Status Types

- **Proposed** - Under consideration
- **Accepted** - Decision approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated** - No longer relevant but kept for history
- **Superseded** - Replaced by another ADR

## Numbering Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.

## Why ADRs Matter

- **Documentation** of important decisions
- **Context** for future developers
- **Traceability** of architectural evolution
- **Learning** from past decisions

## Template

Use the [[../../_templates/adr-template|ADR template]] for new decisions.
