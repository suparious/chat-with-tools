- Cross-conversation context
- Fact accumulation

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Store a memory
tool(action="store", content="User prefers detailed technical explanations", 
     memory_type="preference", tags=["user", "communication"])

# Search memories
tool(action="search", query="technical", tags=["user"])

# Retrieve specific memory
tool(action="retrieve", memory_id="mem_abc123")

# Get statistics
tool(action="stats")
```

### 3. üêç Python Executor Tool (`python_executor`)
**Purpose**: Safe execution of Python code in a sandboxed environment

**Key Features**:
- **Sandboxed execution**: Safe from system damage
- **Timeout protection**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Memory limits**: Controls resource usage
- **Available libraries**: math, random, statistics, collections, json, datetime, pandas, numpy
- **Result capture**: Returns output, errors, and final expression value

**Security Features**:
- Blocked dangerous imports (os, sys, subprocess, etc.)
- No file I/O access
- No network access
- Restricted built-ins

**Use Cases**:
- Mathematical calculations
- Data analysis
- Algorithm testing
- String processing
- Statistical computations

**Example Usage**:
```python
tool(code="""
import math
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = statistics.mean(data)
stdev = statistics.stdev(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean}, Std Dev: {stdev}")
{"mean": mean, "stdev": stdev}
""")
```

### 4. üìÑ Summarization Tool (`summarizer`)
**Purpose**: Text summarization and analysis using extractive methods

**Key Features**:
- **Extractive summarization**: Identifies and extracts key sentences
- **Key points extraction**: Pulls out main ideas
- **Text statistics**: Analyzes readability and complexity
- **Configurable length**: Control summary size with ratio parameter
- **Readability scoring**: Flesch Reading Ease calculation

**Use Cases**:
- Condensing long articles
- Creating executive summaries
- Extracting bullet points
- Analyzing text complexity
- Research paper summaries

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Create summary (30% of original)
tool(action="summarize", text=long_text, ratio=0.3)

# Extract key points
tool(action="key_points", text=long_text, num_points=5)

# Analyze text statistics
tool(action="statistics", text=long_text)
```

## Integration with Framework

All new tools:
- ‚úÖ Follow the `BaseTool` interface
- ‚úÖ Are automatically discovered on startup
- ‚úÖ Work with both single-agent and multi-agent modes
- ‚úÖ Include comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Support the orchestrator's parallel execution
- ‚úÖ Are fully configurable via `config.yaml`

## Configuration

Added to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Sequential thinking tool settings
sequential_thinking:
  max_thoughts: 50
  default_confidence: 1.0

# Memory tool settings
memory:
  storage_path: "./agent_memory"
  max_memories: 1000

# Python executor tool settings
code_execution:
  timeout: 5
  max_memory_mb: 100
  allow_imports: false

# Summarization tool settings
summarization:
  default_ratio: 0.3
  max_summary_sentences: 10
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all tools are working:

```bash
python test_tools.py
```

This will:
1. Verify all tools are discovered
2. Test basic execution of each tool
3. Validate tool schemas
4. Report any issues

## Demo Script

Try the interactive demo to see all new tools in action:

```bash
python demo_new_tools.py
```

The demo includes:
- Sequential thinking session example
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Python code execution examples
- Text summarization demonstration

## How These Tools Enhance Chat with Tools

### 1. **Deeper Analysis** 
The sequential thinking tool allows agents to work through complex problems methodically, showing their reasoning process and allowing for corrections.

### 2. **Learning Capability**
The memory tool enables agents to build knowledge over time, making them more effective with continued use.

### 3. **Computational Power**
The Python executor allows agents to perform complex calculations, data analysis, and algorithm implementation on the fly.

### 4. **Information Synthesis**
The summarization tool helps agents process and condense large amounts of information efficiently.

### Combined Power in Multi-Agent Mode

When used with `council_chat.py`, these tools enable scenarios like:
- **Agent 1**: Uses sequential thinking to analyze a problem
- **Agent 2**: Searches for information and summarizes findings  
- **Agent 3**: Executes Python code to validate hypotheses
- **Agent 4**: Checks memory for relevant past experiences
- **Synthesis**: Combines all perspectives into comprehensive answer

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
1. **Vector Database Tool**: For semantic search over memories
2. **Image Analysis Tool**: For processing visual information
3. **API Integration Tool**: For connecting to external services
4. **Database Query Tool**: For structured data access
5. **Workflow Tool**: For multi-step task automation

## Conclusion

These four new tools significantly expand the capabilities of your Chat with Tools framework, transforming it from a search-and-synthesis system into a comprehensive AI assistant platform with reasoning, memory, computation, and analysis capabilities.

The modular design means you can continue adding tools as needed, and the automatic discovery system ensures they integrate seamlessly with your existing architecture.
