# Chat with Tools Framework - Technical Handover Document

**Date**: December 2024  
**Project Owner**: Shaun (Suparious)  
**Location**: `/home/shaun/repos/chat-with-tools`  
**Status**: Functional, preparing for PyPI release

---

## 🎯 Project Mission

Build a production-ready Python framework that emulates Grok's "heavy mode" deep thinking capabilities through multi-agent orchestration with tool access. The framework must excel at two core features:
1. **Accurate use of custom tools** - Agents that reliably select and use the right tools
2. **Parallel multi-agent analysis** - Council mode where multiple agents analyze queries from different perspectives

## 📍 Current State

### What's Working
- ✅ Single agent mode with full tool integration
- ✅ Multi-agent council mode (4+ parallel agents)
- ✅ Tool auto-discovery from `src/tools/` directory
- ✅ 8+ functional tools (search, calculator, file I/O, memory, sequential thinking, Python executor, summarizer)
- ✅ Real-time progress visualization for council mode
- ✅ Modern packaging setup (pyproject.toml)
- ✅ Professional CLI interface (`cwt` command)
- ✅ Comprehensive test framework

### Recent Refactoring (December 2024)
Just completed major reorganization to address these issues:
- **Problem**: Menu options were confusing with overlapping demos
- **Solution**: Created clear, hierarchical menu structure with distinct categories
- **Added**: Professional CLI, Makefile, modern packaging, improved documentation
- **Result**: Framework now ready for PyPI publication

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

```
src/
├── agent.py                 # Single agent implementation with tool loop
├── agent_enhanced.py        # Enhanced agent with better error handling
├── orchestrator.py          # Multi-agent coordinator for council mode
├── utils.py                 # Shared utilities
└── tools/                   # Plugin-based tool system
    ├── base_tool.py         # Abstract base class all tools inherit from
    ├── __init__.py          # Auto-discovery mechanism
    └── *_tool.py            # Individual tool implementations
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Tool Plugin System**
   - Tools inherit from `BaseTool` abstract class
   - Must implement: `name`, `description`, `parameters`, `execute()`
   - Auto-discovered at runtime from `src/tools/` directory
   - Hot-swappable without code changes

2. **Agent Loop Pattern**
   ```python
   # Simplified flow in agent.py
   while not done and iterations < max:
       response = llm_call(messages)
       if tool_calls in response:
           execute_tools()
           append_results_to_messages
       else:
           done = True
   ```

3. **Orchestrator Pattern**
   - Generates N specialized questions from user query
   - Spawns N agents in parallel threads
   - Each agent gets unique question + original context
   - Synthesis agent combines all responses
   - Progress tracked via shared dict with thread locks

### Configuration System

**Primary config**: `config/config.yaml`
```yaml
openrouter:
  api_key: "..."           # OpenRouter API key (required)
  model: "openai/gpt-4-mini"  # Any OpenRouter model
orchestrator:
  parallel_agents: 4       # Agents in council mode
  task_timeout: 300        # Seconds per agent
```

**Environment variable overrides** (set in CLI):
- `CWT_MODEL_OVERRIDE` - Override model
- `CWT_NUM_AGENTS` - Override agent count
- `CWT_AGENT_TIMEOUT` - Override timeout

## 🔧 Critical Implementation Details

### Tool Execution Flow

1. **Tool Discovery** (`src/tools/__init__.py`):
   ```python
   # Automatically imports all *_tool.py files
   # Creates AVAILABLE_TOOLS dict mapping name -> class
   ```

2. **Tool Schema Generation**:
   - Each tool provides OpenAI function-calling compatible schema
   - Sent to LLM in system prompt
   - LLM returns tool calls in structured format

3. **Tool Execution**:
   - Parse tool calls from LLM response
   - Instantiate tool class
   - Call `execute()` with parameters
   - Return results to agent

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

1. **Question Generation**:
   - Separate LLM call to generate N specialized questions
   - Each question targets different aspect of query

2. **Parallel Execution**:
   ```python
   # In orchestrator.py
   with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_agents) as executor:
       futures = []
       for i, question in enumerate(questions):
           future = executor.submit(run_agent, question, agent_id=i)
           futures.append(future)
   ```

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Shared dict with agent_id -> status
   - Thread locks prevent race conditions
   - Council_chat.py polls status for live display

4. **Response Synthesis**:
   - All agent responses collected
   - Single synthesis prompt combines them
   - Final unified response returned

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Gotchas

### Current Pain Points

1. **Config File Required**:
   - Framework crashes if `config/config.yaml` doesn't exist
   - Must copy from `config.example.yaml` manually
   - Consider auto-creating on first run

2. **API Key Validation**:
   - No validation that OpenRouter key is valid
   - Fails at runtime with cryptic errors
   - Should add pre-flight check

3. **Tool Error Handling**:
   - Tools that crash can break entire agent loop
   - Need better isolation/sandboxing
   - Some tools lack timeout protection

4. **Memory Tool Persistence**:
   - Creates `agent_memory/` directory automatically
   - Can grow unbounded
   - No cleanup mechanism implemented

5. **Import Structure**:
   - Demos use `sys.path.append` hack
   - Should properly install package instead
   - Makes testing difficult

### Technical Debt

- **Threading vs Async**: Orchestrator uses threads, could be more efficient with asyncio
- **No Rate Limiting**: Can hit API rate limits with many parallel agents
- **Limited Testing**: Many tools lack comprehensive unit tests
- **Hardcoded Prompts**: System prompts embedded in code, should be configurable
- **No Streaming**: Responses come all at once, no streaming support

## 🚀 Development Priorities

### Immediate (Before PyPI Release)
1. Add automatic config initialization
2. Implement API key validation
3. Add proper error boundaries for tools
4. Write comprehensive test suite
5. Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Short Term
1. Add streaming response support
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Create web UI (FastAPI + React)
4. Add tool result caching
5. Implement conversation memory

### Long Term
1. Vector database integration for long-term memory
2. Custom model fine-tuning support
3. Tool marketplace/registry
4. Distributed agent execution
5. Production deployment guides

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
make test

# With coverage
make test-cov

# Specific test file
python tests/test_tools.py

## 📝 Code Snippets for Common Tasks

### Adding a New Tool
```python
# src/tools/weather_tool.py
from .base_tool import BaseTool

class WeatherTool(BaseTool):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "get_weather"
    
    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Get current weather for a location"
    
    @property
    def parameters(self) -> dict:
        return {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City name"}
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    
    def execute(self, location: str) -> dict:
        # Implementation here
        return {"temperature": 72, "condition": "sunny"}
```

### Changing Number of Agents
```python
# In config/config.yaml
orchestrator:
  parallel_agents: 6  # Change from 4 to 6

# Or via environment
export CWT_NUM_AGENTS=6
```

### Custom Model Usage
```python
# In config/config.yaml
openrouter:
  model: "anthropic/claude-3-opus"  # Use any OpenRouter model
```

4. Can handle 100+ requests/minute in production
5. PyPI package has 1000+ downloads

## 🤝 Handover Notes

**For the next developer** (or future me):

1. **Start here**: Run `python main.py` to see current state
2. **Test everything**: Use `make test` before any changes
3. **Config is key**: Most issues stem from config problems
4. **Tools are isolated**: Tool bugs shouldn't crash framework
5. **Parallel is complex**: Orchestrator threading needs careful handling
6. **User-first**: Focus on making it "just work" for end users

**Current momentum**: Just finished major refactoring. Framework is clean, organized, and ready for PyPI. Next step should be publishing to TestPyPI and getting community feedback.

**Philosophy**: This isn't just another LLM wrapper. It's a production framework for building sophisticated AI agents with tools. Keep it professional, maintainable, and user-friendly.
